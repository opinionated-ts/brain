# Universal AI Config (uac)

This project uses **universal-ai-config** (`uac`) to manage AI tool configurations from a single set of templates. Instead of maintaining separate config files for Claude, Copilot, Cursor, and Codex, templates in `<%= config.templatesDir %>/` are the source of truth — run `uac generate` to produce target-specific files.

**Do not edit generated config files directly** — changes will be overwritten. Always edit the source templates in `<%= config.templatesDir %>/`.

## Invoking uac

First, you must figure out what the project's local package manager is. Other instructions may specify this, or you can infer it some other way. Then, use the project's local package manager to run `uac`.

Examples for different package managers:

- **pnpm**: `pnpm uac <command>`
- **npm**: `npm uac <command>`
- **yarn**: `yarn uac <command>`
- **bun**: `bun uac <command>`

If `uac` is not a local dependency (e.g. non-JS projects): `npx universal-ai-config <command>`

## Project root resolution

When run without `--root`, uac searches **upward** from the current directory for the project root — the nearest ancestor containing a `universal-ai-config.config.*` file or a `<%= config.templatesDir %>/` folder. This means you can run `uac generate` (and the other commands) from inside a package subdirectory of a monorepo and it will still find the root. When a root is found above the current directory, uac prints an info line naming the directory it's using. If no root is found anywhere up the tree, it falls back to the current directory.

- `--root, -r <path>` always wins and disables the upward search — uac uses exactly the path you give.
- `uac init` is the exception: it never walks up and always scaffolds into the current directory (or `--root`), since its job is to create a new project rather than find an existing one.

## CLI Commands

### `uac generate`

Generate target-specific config files from templates.

- `--target, -t <targets>` — comma-separated targets: `claude`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `codex`
- `--type <types>` — comma-separated types: `instructions`, `skills`, `agents`, `hooks`, `mcp`
- `--dry-run, -d` — preview what would be generated without writing files
- `--clean` — remove existing generated files before generating. Scoped by `--type`: `--clean` alone removes everything, but combined with `--type skills` it only cleans skills artifacts, leaving other types in place. Combined with `--dry-run` it previews the removals instead of performing them. With no `--target` it cleans **every** target, not just the ones in your config — see [`uac clean`](#uac-clean).

### `uac init`

Scaffold a new `.universal-ai-config/` directory with meta-instruction templates and config file.

### `uac seed <type>`

Seed pre-built template sets into the templates directory. Available types: `meta-instructions`, `examples`, `gitignore`.

### `uac clean`

Remove all generated config directories.

- `--target, -t <targets>` — comma-separated targets to clean (default: every registered target)
- `--type <types>` — comma-separated types to clean: `instructions`, `skills`, `agents`, `hooks`, `mcp` (default: all types)
- `--config, -c <path>` — config file path
- `--dry-run, -d` — print what would be removed without deleting

With no `--target`, clean removes artifacts for **every registered target**, not only those in your config's `targets`. That's deliberate: dropping `codex` from `targets` would otherwise strand its `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/`, and `<dir>/AGENTS.override.md` files on disk forever, where Codex keeps reading them. Narrow with `--target` when you want less.

Clean loads your config so `outputDirs`, `preserveOnClean`, and `templatesDir` are honored.

Codex's `<dir>/AGENTS.override.md` files are located by **scanning the project tree** rather than from a fixed list — their paths come from each template's `globs` prefix, so they move when templates change. The scan skips `node_modules`, `.git`, build output, and `templatesDir`, and matches that basename exactly (never `AGENTS.md`, which users hand-author in nested directories). This is what removes orphans left behind by a deleted template, an edited `globs`, or a dropped target.

### `uac skill add <source>`

Download skill(s) from a GitHub repo or local path and write them into `<%= config.templatesDir %>/skills/<name>/` as new skill templates. Each downloaded skill becomes a normal uac skill template — run `uac generate` afterwards to produce the per-target outputs. Skills are always **copied** into the current project (no global installs or symlinks). Re-adding an existing skill **overrides** it (a clean update — stale files are removed).

The `source` accepts:

- GitHub shorthand: `owner/repo`, `owner/repo/subpath`, `owner/repo@skill-name`
- `github:owner/repo` prefix
- github.com URLs: `https://github.com/owner/repo[/tree/<ref>[/<subpath>]]`
- a `#ref` / `#ref@skill` fragment on any git form (selects a branch/tag/commit)
- a local filesystem path: `./dir`, `../dir`, `/abs/path`

Flags:

- `--skill, -s <names>` — comma-separated skill names to install (otherwise you'll be prompted to select)
- `--all` — install every discovered skill
- `--list, -l` — list discovered skills without installing
- `--yes, -y` — skip confirmation prompts
- `--ref <ref>` — branch, tag, or commit to fetch (alternative to a `#ref` fragment)
- `--root, -r <path>` — project root (default: nearest uac root, searching up from cwd; see [Project root resolution](#project-root-resolution))

With no `--skill`/`--all`/`--list` and multiple skills found, an interactive multiselect wizard lets you pick which to install. Examples:

```bash
uac skill add vercel-labs/agent-skills --list          # list available skills
uac skill add vercel-labs/agent-skills                 # pick interactively
uac skill add vercel-labs/agent-skills -s vercel-optimize -y
uac skill add owner/repo@my-skill                      # install a single named skill
uac skill add ./local/skills-repo --all                # copy every skill from a local repo
```

## Configuration

The config file (`universal-ai-config.config.ts`) supports these options:

- `templatesDir` — templates directory (default: `.universal-ai-config`)
- `additionalTemplateDirs` — extra directories to discover templates from; supports absolute paths, relative paths, and `~` for home directory (default: `[]`). On a name conflict the **first mention wins**: `templatesDir`, then each entry in order. See [Template precedence](#template-precedence) below.
- `targets` — which targets to generate (default: all)
- `types` — which template types to generate (default: all)
- `variables` — custom variables for templates (EJS in markdown, typed `{{var}}` in JSON — exact-match placeholders resolve to raw values like arrays/objects)
- `outputDirs` — override default output directories per target
- `exclude` — glob patterns to skip templates from generation (array or per-target object). Prefix a pattern with a source directory to skip just that copy — see [Template precedence](#template-precedence).
- `preserveOnClean` — glob patterns matching **output** paths that `uac clean` must never delete (array or per-target object). See [Preserving files from clean](#preserving-files-from-clean) below.
- `mcp` — server-name-level opt-in filtering for MCP. `mcp.forceOptIn` toggles allow-list mode per target; `mcp.mcpServers` lists which server names are emitted when opt-in is active. See [MCP opt-in filtering](#mcp-opt-in-filtering) below.

### Template Exclusion

The `exclude` option accepts glob patterns matching **input template paths** relative to `templatesDir` (not output paths):

```typescript
// Same exclusions for all targets
exclude: ["agents/internal-only.md", "hooks/debug.json", "mcp/internal.json"]

// Different exclusions per target
exclude: {
  claude: ["agents/copilot-reviewer.md"],
  copilot: ["skills/**"],
  default: [],
}
```

For instructions/skills/agents one input file maps to one output, so exclusion is 1:1. For **hooks** and **MCP**, multiple input JSON files merge into a single output: excluding `hooks/debug.json` or `mcp/internal.json` drops every handler/server that file declared. The `exclude` option does not target individual hook handlers or named MCP servers — only the whole input file containing it. For MCP specifically, see `mcp.forceOptIn` / `mcp.mcpServers` below for server-name-level filtering.

Patterns can also be **source-qualified** — prefixed with the directory the template came from — which is how you pick a different copy when several directories declare the same name:

```typescript
exclude: {
  // Drop this project's copy so the one from a shared dir is used, for Claude only
  claude: [".universal-ai-config/instructions/style.md"],
  default: [],
}
```

An unqualified pattern (`instructions/style.md`) still drops the template from every source. Any spelling of the directory resolves to the same candidate — as written in config, absolute, or `~`-relative. See [Template precedence](#template-precedence).

### Template Precedence

Templates are discovered from `templatesDir` first, then from each `additionalTemplateDirs` entry in configured order. When the same name shows up more than once, **the first one in that chain wins** and the rest are _shadowed_. This holds for every type:

| Type                  | Identity                                            | What the loser loses                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| instructions / agents | filename without `.md`                              | the whole file                       |
| skills                | folder name                                         | the whole folder, extra files too    |
| hooks                 | JSON basename, then each identical resolved handler | that file / that handler             |
| mcp                   | JSON basename, then server name, then input `id`    | that file / that server / that input |

Notes:

- Skill folders are **replaced, not merged** — a shadowed copy's extra files never leak into the winner.
- Hooks/MCP files with **different** basenames still merge; shadowing only resolves same-named files. The sub-file identities (handler, server name, input id) are what make that merge first-wins too.
- A skill folder with no `SKILL.md` doesn't claim its name, so a lower-precedence dir with a real skill wins it.
- Within a single directory — two `mcp/*.json` files declaring the same server name, say — files are read in alphabetical order, so the winner doesn't depend on the filesystem.
- To use a lower-precedence copy, exclude the winner by its source-qualified path (see [Template Exclusion](#template-exclusion)). Since `exclude` is per-target, one target can use the shared copy while another keeps the local one.
- `uac generate` prints a one-line shadowing count; `uac generate --verbose` lists each shadowed candidate. Candidates you excluded yourself are never listed.

### Preserving Files From Clean

`preserveOnClean` is the mirror image of `exclude`: patterns match **output** paths relative to the project root, not template input paths. Anything matching is left alone by `uac clean` and `uac generate --clean`.

```typescript
// Keep a hand-authored, committed AGENTS.md that uac would otherwise delete
preserveOnClean: ["AGENTS.md"]

// Per-target form
preserveOnClean: {
  codex: ["AGENTS.md"],
  claude: [".claude/skills/manual/**"],
  default: [],
}
```

Reach for it whenever a path uac treats as a generated artifact is actually maintained by hand. Root `AGENTS.md` and `<dir>/AGENTS.override.md` are the usual cases — clean removes them because they exist at a uac-managed path, not because uac verified it wrote them.

Notes:

- Cleaning a directory that contains a preserved file removes the directory's **other** contents and leaves the directory itself in place (e.g. `preserveOnClean: [".claude/skills/manual/**"]` keeps that one skill while every other generated skill goes).
- Preserved paths that actually exist are listed in the clean output, so you can see what was skipped.
- Like `exclude`, an overrides config **replaces** this array; use `mergeField` to concatenate.

### MCP Opt-In Filtering

MCP servers can heavily affect agent performance — more servers means more tools loaded, more context, and slower decisions. When you only want a subset of the servers declared across your `mcp/*.json` files, use opt-in mode:

```typescript
mcp: {
  forceOptIn: true,
  mcpServers: ["github", "playwright"],
}
```

When `forceOptIn` resolves to `true` for a target, **only** servers whose names appear in `mcpServers` are emitted — regardless of how many input files declare them. When `forceOptIn` is `false` or unset (the default), all discovered servers pass through, matching the original behavior.

Both fields accept the standard per-target shape, so you can opt-in selectively:

```typescript
mcp: {
  forceOptIn: { claude: true, default: false },
  mcpServers: {
    claude: ["github"],
    copilot: ["github", "playwright"],
    default: [],
  },
}
```

Notes:

- `mcpServers: []` with `forceOptIn: true` → no servers emitted for that target, MCP output file skipped entirely.
- Unknown names (typos, renamed servers) emit a `[uac]` warning listing the known names; generation continues with the matched subset.
- Filtering operates on **server names** (the keys under `mcpServers` inside each `mcp/*.json`). Field-level per-target overrides on individual servers still resolve before filtering.
- Copilot `inputs` (interactive prompts) are not filtered — they're declarative and not tied to specific server names.

## Merging Config Fields

When using an overrides config, array fields like `exclude` are **replaced** entirely by default. To **concatenate** instead, use the `mergeField` helper:

```typescript
// universal-ai-config.overrides.ts
import { defineConfig, mergeField } from "universal-ai-config";
import base from "./universal-ai-config.config";

export default defineConfig({
  exclude: mergeField(base.exclude, ["additional-pattern/**"]),
});
```

`mergeField` handles plain arrays, per-target objects, and mixed combinations. Plain arrays are treated as the `default` value, and target-specific keys fall back to `default` when absent.

## Codex output paths

Unlike the other three targets, Codex emits files in **multiple locations** outside its `outputDir`. This is intentional — Codex auto-discovers these standard locations:

- **`AGENTS.md` at project root** — concatenation of all `alwaysApply: true` instructions (plus templates with leading-wildcard or no globs)
- **`<dir>/AGENTS.override.md`** — per-directory instruction files derived from `globs` prefixes. Editing a template's `globs` **moves** this file; `uac clean` finds the old location by scanning for the basename, so run `uac generate --clean` after a glob change rather than plain `uac generate`
- **`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** — root-relative, per Codex's auto-discovery convention; sidecar `agents/openai.yaml` emitted next to SKILL.md when relevant
- **`.codex/agents/<name>.toml`** — standalone agent files (auto-discovered by Codex)
- **`.codex/hooks.json`** — JSON hooks file
- **`.codex/config.toml`** — only the `[mcp_servers.*]` table is uac-owned; users can hand-author other top-level keys (profiles, providers, permissions, personality, etc.) and uac preserves them

All of these are gitignored by `uac seed gitignore` so each developer regenerates locally. If you deliberately commit a hand-authored file at one of these paths, add it to `preserveOnClean` — otherwise clean removes it.
